## Shrine Helper

This tool will help you find any missing shrines you have. Just upload screenshots of the top and bottom halves of your map. You can choose to see exactly which shrines are missing but if you want to tap into your inner explorer, you can choose to only receive hints on where the missing shrines are.

A few small notes, this was only tested on Nintendo Switch so I'm not sure if WiiU screenshots will work or not. Let me know! Last thing is that this tool won't work if you don't have all the towers activated. Should you really be using this tool if you have some regions that haven't been discovered yet?

Alright that's it. Happy hunting!
