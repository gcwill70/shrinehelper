## Shrine Helper

This tool will help you find any missing shrines you have. Just upload screenshots of the top and bottom halves of your map, choose what information you want to be revealed about them, and click 'Find Shrines'! Oh and by design, this tool won't work if you don't at least have all the towers activated.

Alright that's it. Happy hunting!

### 1. Upload screenshots
Open up your map and move the cursor near position that's shown in each example. Take a screenshot and upload it.
(Upload top half)
(Upload bottom half)
### 2. Choose Info to Show
Choose which information will be shown about missing shrines. I recommend trying to find them with as little help as possible.
- Shrine Name
- Region (i) -> Region of shrine (Central Hyrule, Hebra, Eldin, etc.)
- Discovery Method (i) -> This option will show how the shrine can be discovered. Some shrines are discoverable with the Sheikah Sensor while some have an associated quest.
  - If sensible, describe general location of shrine (northeast Lanayru)
  - If quest, describe general location of quest giver
### 3. Discover Shrines
(Find Shrines)
