        <p>This tool will help you find any missing shrines you have. Just upload screenshots of the top and bottom halves of your map, choose what information you want to be revealed about them, and click 'Find Shrines'! This tool won't work if you don't at least have all the towers activated.</p>

        <p>Alright that's it. Happy hunting!</p>

        <ol>
            <li>Upload screenshots
                <p>Open up your map and move the cursor near position that's shown in each example. Take the screenshots and upload them.<br>
